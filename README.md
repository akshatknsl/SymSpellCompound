### SymSpellCompound has been integrated into [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell). Please visit the [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell) repository!  

__Compound aware automatic spelling correction__

__SymSpellCompound__ supports __compound__ aware __automatic__ spelling correction of __multi-word input__ strings. <br>It is built on top of [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell)'s __1 million times faster__ spelling correction algorithm.

__1. Compound splitting & decompounding__

SymSpell assumed every input string as _single term_. SymSpellCompound supports _compound splitting / decompounding_ with three cases:
1. mistakenly __inserted space within a correct word__ led to two incorrect terms 
2. mistakenly __omitted space between two correct words__ led to one incorrect combined term
3. __multiple input terms__ with/without spelling errors

Splitting errors, concatenation errors, substitution errors, transposition errors, deletion errors and insertion errors can by mixed within the same word.

__2. Automatic spelling correction__

* Large document collections make manual correction infeasible and require unsupervised, fully-automatic spelling correction. 
* In conventional spelling correction of a single token, the user is presented with spelling correction suggestions. <br>For automatic spelling correction of long multi-word text the the algorithm itself has to make an educated choice.

__Examples:__

__Performance__

0.2 milliseconds / word  
5000 words / second  (single core on 2012 Macbook Pro)

__Applications__

* Query correction (10â€“15% of queries contain misspelled terms),
* Chatbots,
* OCR post-processing,
* Automated proofreading.
